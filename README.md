Movie Sentiment Analysis

Movie sentiment analysis is a process that involves analyzing and understanding the sentiments expressed in movie-related text data, such as reviews, comments, or social media posts. The goal is to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) conveyed by the text. This analysis can be valuable for various stakeholders, including movie studios, reviewers, and audiences, by providing insights into public opinion and reception.
